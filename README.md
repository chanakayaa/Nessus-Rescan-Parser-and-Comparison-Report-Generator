# Nessus-Rescan-Parser-and-Comparison-Report-Generator
This Python script is designed to parse two Nessus XML files: an initial scan and a rescan. It compares the vulnerabilities found in both scans and generates an HTML report summarizing the vulnerabilities that were not fixed. The report includes details such as the vulnerability name, its criticality, and the affected IP addresses.
